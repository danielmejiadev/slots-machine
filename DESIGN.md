# Start the app
```bash
cd slot-machine-server
yarn install
yarn start:dev
```

Backend server is initiated in `http://localhost:4000`

```bash
cd slot-machine-ui
yarn install
yarn start
```

Fronted is initiated in `http://localhost:3000`

## Initial State

The idea is to have the state in an object with all the required information.
```js
const game = {
  credits: 10, // How many credits the user currently has, initial to 10
  cost: 1, // What is the cost of rolling the machine, initial is 1, I decided to make this dynamic so we can adjust this anytime.
  result: [null, null, null], // The result of the rolling, initial is null.
  symbols: [ // All the symbols supported for the machine, with the icon to display and the reward when winning.
    {
      name: 'cherry',
      icon: 'üçí',
      reward: 10,
    },
    {
      name: 'lemon',
      icon: 'üçã',
      reward: 20,
    },
    {
      name: 'orange',
      icon: 'üü†',
      reward: 30,
    },
    {
      name: 'watermelon',
      icon: 'üçâ',
      reward: 40,
    },
  ],
};
```

## API ENDPOINTS
You can find the entire documentation for each endpoint running
```bash
cd slot-machine-server
yarn install
yarn start:dev
```

Go to and check the swagger documentation generated.
`http://localhost:4000/api`

## UI components
App: RootComponent to start the game with the button.
Initializer: Component with information to start the game.
SlotMachine: Container for the game to
  GameReporter: UI to display all the game information

## UI packages
* /api, Service to consume all resources from backend using axios and organized in the same file.
* react-hooks-util: This is a open source package created by myself with a lot of reusable react hooks, in this case I'm using `useFetch` to have all the data from server in a react state and calling all the resource in api.
